# Classification_Project
Classification project for my ML course where the objective was to compare the performance of Logistic Regression with that of a Random Forest. The dataset is composed of 1300 samples with 31 features each. The first column is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There are 5 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric features, except for the last column which is categorical (with 3 categories).  Furthermore, the classes are unbalanced: some labels are more frequent than others.
